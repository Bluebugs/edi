title: New editor in 0.0.9 release
---

Today I'm thrilled to announce the *0.0.9* release of EDI.
I had planned that 0.1 would be the next release but due to lots of
change with the EFL at this time the full stable release is not going to be until August.
Therefore I decided to roll back a few small changes that required 
latest efl so that one could be released against 1.14.

The dependencies that the 0.0.9 release require are readily available
in many distributions - I have tested in Arch Linux and it works well.

The main reason to get this release out earlier is to let everyone
try out the cool new code editor that is a key part of EDI's future.
Whist performance and usability are important parts of the widget
architecture you should notice it supports more features such as
highlighting lines with errors (hover to read the error) or TODOs.

As always I hope that you like the update - please do report bugs
through the app's About screen or on http://phab.enlightenment.org/ .
