title: Released 0.4.0 for EFL 1.18 long term support
---

Wow, it's been a long time since our last releae and we've seen quite a bit
of change. Our code editor (Elm_Code) has been merged into the main 
Enlightenment Foundation Libraries and was packaged in the 1.18 release last week. Because of this we decided it was time for another release. Hopefully this will mean that we can stay off tracking efl-git for a while :).

As well as the library changes we have added the following features since 0.3.0

* Filter file list based on ignored build files
* Allow filtering of file list using regular expressions
* Display build errors inline in editor
* Support opening a single file

We also updated the app with some changes in icons so you should get a more
consistent UI going forward.

As always I hope that you like the update - please do report bugs
through the app's About screen or on http://phab.enlightenment.org/ .
