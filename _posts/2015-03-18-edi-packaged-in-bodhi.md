title: EDI is now packaged in Bodhi Linux
---

I was excited to be informed by Jef91 that he decided to package and upload EDI for the latest distribution of [Bodhi linux](http://www.bodhilinux.com)! You can find the page (and rate it) in the [App Center](http://www.bodhilinux.com/a/edi/).

OnlyHuman also let me know that he's packaging it into the latest versions of his [e19 community remaster](http://www.pclinuxos.com/forum/index.php/topic,131132.0.html) of PC Linux OS.

I'm totally thrilled that it's out there and look forward to getting people's feedback on the app.
Whilst it is very early days the more people that use it mean we can improve it lots before the first major release.
