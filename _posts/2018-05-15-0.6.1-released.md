title: Notifications, EFL examples and Go syntax support added to Edi in 0.6.1
---

Edi 0.6.1 is a fairly large point release update, but not quite big enough to be 0.7!
The full list of feature additions is:

* Added notification support.
* Added split-view option for editors.
* Updated project wizard and added new project templates.
* Include EFL examples in project wizard.
* Add support for Go projects.
* Improved debugging support.
* Added edi\_scm helper command.
* Replace all in project.

There are also lots of stability fixes, most of them focussed on SCM git support.
