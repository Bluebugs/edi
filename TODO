This project is in heavy development, we are currenty working towards the
"Code aware editor" phase, the following work is still to be done:

* Replace text (project-wide)
* Code folding
* Split pane view (split a tab to multiple views on a file)
* Automatic code indenting / formatting
* notepad, emacs and vim and editing modes (key bindings)
* LLVM parsing
* Integrated console
* Cross reference for c, c++ and some scripting language
* Support for EditorConfig - http://editorconfig.org/

The next phase is "Basic IDE" and it, along with other future phases
are documented online at https://phab.enlightenment.org/w/projects/edi/
