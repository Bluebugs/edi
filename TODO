This project is in heavy development, we are currenty working towards the
"Code aware editor" phase, the following work is still to be done:

* Replace in file
* Redo changes that have been undone
* Add a menu for easier access to some features
* Search / replace in project / directory
* Creation of new projects from name input and skeleton project files
* Automatic code indenting / formatting
* Integrate elm_code project (cedric and TAsn)
  - Code folding
  - Code expansion (nested display of function call body)
* Integrated console
* notepad, emacs and vim and editing modes
* Documentation finding
* Compilation error message integrated in the flow of code
* Cross reference for c, c++ and some scripting language

Bugs to fix:

* Remember last project and allow new project to be loaded (new window or current)
* Remember position and size of windows and panels
* Monitor filesystem for changes and refresh file tree

The next phase is "Basic IDE" and it, along with other future phases
are documented online at https://phab.enlightenment.org/w/edi/
