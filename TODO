This project is in heavy development, we are currenty working towards the
"Basic text editing" phase, the following work is still to be done:

* Opening editor in a new window
* Remember last project and allow new project to be loaded (new window or current)
* No screen waste (toolbar, menu, tab are out of the way of the developer)

Bugs to fix:

* Icons are missing from toolbar and context menu
* Remember position and size of window and panels

The next phase is "Code aware editor" and it, along with other future phases
are documented online at https://phab.enlightenment.org/w/edi/
